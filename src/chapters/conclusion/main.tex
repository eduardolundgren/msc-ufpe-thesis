The web browser is an environment that still doesn't have the appropriate attention inside the academic world. This research has raised many possibilities. The first one is a publication detailing web browser concepts and APIs that can leverage visual tracking and AR applications to be developed into this platform. The second is another publication comparing client-side JavaScript based tracking with client-side plugin-based and server-side solutions. The growth of the library modules is also part of future work plan, trough bringing more related algorithms and techniques to \textit{tracking.js} library, such as Double Exponential Smoothing \cite{LaViola2003}, a Perspective-$n$-Point problem (P$n$P) calculation and a image processing layer capable of simple transformations and filters, such as saturation, sharpen, sobel, laplacian, gaussian and prewitt \cite{Gonzalez2007}. Those improvements could potentially help visual tracking and AR techniques to be implemented on top of \textit{tracking.js}.
