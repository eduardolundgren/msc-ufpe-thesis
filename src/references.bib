abstract = {While feature point recognition is a key component of modern approaches to object detection, existing approaches require computationally expensive patch preprocessing to handle perspective distortion. In this paper, we show that formulating the problem in a naive Bayesian classification framework makes such preprocessing unnecessary and produces an algorithm that is simple, efficient, and robust. Furthermore, it scales well as the number of classes grows. To recognize the patches surrounding keypoints, our classifier uses hundreds of simple binary features and models class posterior probabilities. We make the problem computationally tractable by assuming independence between arbitrary sets of features. Even though this is not strictly true, we demonstrate that our classifier nevertheless performs remarkably well on image data sets containing very significant perspective changes.},

abstract = {We propose to use binary strings as an efficient feature point descriptor, which we call BRIEF.We show that it is highly discriminative even when using relatively few bits and can be computed using simple intensity difference tests. Furthermore, the descriptor similarity can be evaluated using the Hamming distance, which is very efficient to compute, instead of the L 2 norm as is usually done. As a result, BRIEF is very fast both to build and to match. We compare it against SURF and U-SURF on standard benchmarks and show that it yields a similar or better recognition performance, while running in a fraction of the time required by either.},

This research field is applied by the TechPetro project that aims to define and developed a Markerless Augmented Reality framework for the implementation of Augmented Reality based engineering solutions. In Markerless Augmented Reality, 3D virtual objects are integrated into a 3D real environment in real-time. This is achieved using the world as marker instead of fiducial markers applied in traditional Augmented Reality systems. It discusses major issues related to the field, such as tracking and registration, which become much more complex. This paper also describes the characteristics and experimental results of online monocular Markerless Augmented Reality techniques. Future directions and areas requiring further research are briefly discussed. This survey provides a starting point for anyone interested in researching or using Markerless Augmented Reality.},

First, we introduce a taxonomy that classifies current approaches to shared spaces according to the three dimensions of transportation, artificiality, and spatiality. Second, we discuss our experience of staging a poetry performance simultaneously within real and virtual theaters. This demonstrates the complexities involved in establishing social interaction between real and virtual spaces and motivates the development of a systematic approach to mixing realities. Third, we introduce and demonstrate the technique of mixed-reality boundaries as a way of joining real and virtual spaces together in order to address some of these problems.},

@article{Lepetit2005,
abstract = {Many applications require tracking of complex 3D objects. These include visual servoing of robotic arms on specific target objects, Augmented Reality systems that require real-time registration of the object to be augmented, and head tracking systems that sophisticated interfaces can use. Computer Vision offers solutions that are cheap, practical and non-invasive. This survey reviews the different techniques and approaches that have been developed by industry and research. First, important mathematical tools are introduced: Camera representation, robust estimation and uncertainty estimation. Then a comprehensive study is given of the numerous approaches developed by the Augmented Reality and Robotics communities, beginning with those that are based on point or planar fiducial marks and moving on to those that avoid the need to engineer the environment by relying on natural features such as edges, texture or interest. Recent advances that avoid manual initialization and failures due to fast motion are also presented. The survery concludes with the different possible choices that should be made when implementing a 3D tracking system and a discussion of the future of vision-based 3D tracking. Because it encompasses many computer vision techniques from lowlevel vision to 3D geometry and includes a comprehensive study of the massive literature on the subject, this survey should be the handbook of the student, the researcher, or the engineer who wants to implement a 3D tracking system.},

abstract = {This paper investigates long-term tracking of unknown objects in a video stream. The object is defined by its location and extent in a single frame. In every frame that follows, the task is to determine the object's location and extent or indicate that the object is not present. We propose a novel tracking framework (TLD) that explicitly decomposes the long-term tracking task into tracking, learning and detection. The tracker follows the object from frame to frame. The detector localizes all appearances that have been observed so far and corrects the tracker if necessary. The learning estimates detector's errors and updates it to avoid these errors in the future. We study how to identify detector's errors and learn from them. We develop a novel learning method (P-N learning) which estimates the errors by a pair of "experts'': (i) P-expert estimates missed detections, and (ii) N-expert estimates false alarms. The learning process is modeled as a discrete dynamical system and the conditions under which the learning guarantees improvement are found. We describe our real-time implementation of the TLD framework and the P-N learning. We carry out an extensive quantitative evaluation which shows a significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches.},

Various algorithms are discussed ranging from the most basic linear algorithm to statistical optimization. Non-linear algorithms for homography estimation are broken down into the cost functions that they aim to minimize. Robust estimation techniques with respect to outlier correspondences are covered as well as al gorithms making use of non-point correspondences such as lines and conics.

@article{International2009,
abstract = {This Ecma Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that companys Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0. The development of this Standard started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997. That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in nature. The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of forthcoming internationalisation facilities and future language growth. The third edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June 2002. Since publication of the third edition, ECMAScript has achieved massive adoption in conjunction with the World Wide Web where it has become the programming language that is supported by essentially all web browsers. Significant work was done to develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript. Although that work was not completed and not published1 as the fourth edition of ECMAScript, it informs continuing evolution of the language. The present fifth edition of ECMAScript (published as ECMA-262 5th edition) codifies de facto interpretations of the language specification that have become common among browser implementations and adds support for new features that have emerged since the publication of the third edition. Such features include accessor properties, reflective creation and inspection of objects, program control of property attributes, additional array manipulation functions, support for the JSON object encoding format, and a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security. ECMAScript is a vibrant language and the evolution of the language is not complete. Significant technical enhancement will continue with future editions of this specification.},
